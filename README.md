# Big Book of Computers
> A repository of problems and solutions.

These are my notes, ramblings, and helpful comments about the tools I use in my professional and
personal life.

This project is intended to act as a shortcut to remembering how to accomplish the documented tasks.
Where code snippets are provided, they should be used with caution and with an understanding of
what each command will do.
However, this is not a step-by-step guide to doing everything, some independent research is
expected in places.

# Getting Started

> How do you know if someone uses Arch Linux? Don't worry, they'll tell you.

I use Arch btw.
This means that for simplicity and consistency, all code snippets will be given in terms of 
Arch Linux.
Most high-level commands- like `docker` or `npm`- translate to other Linux distros without any
changes.
Closer to the OS, things like `pacman` and `journalctl` may not exist at all.
The same concepts will exist but through other commands.
